# **Machine Learning Classification Project**

## ðŸ“Œ **Overview**
This repository contains **Jupyter notebooks** documenting my introduction to **machine learning**, with a specific focus on **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**. 

Through these projects, I explored fundamental machine learning concepts, including:
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Building
- Training and Evaluation
- Visualization of Results

I used **PyTorch** as the primary framework for building and training neural networks, providing a strong foundation in understanding **how ANNs function**.
