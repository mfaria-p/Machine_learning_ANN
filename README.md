# Machine Learning Classification

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that document my introduction to machine learning, with a specific focus on __Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)__. 

Through these projects, I explored the fundamental concepts of machine learning, including data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results. 

I used __PyTorch__ as the primary framework for building and training the neural networks, which provided me with a solid foundation in understanding how ANNs function.

# Notebooks Overview

## 00_Classify_Querties

In this notebook, I developed an ANN to classify two distinct types of "Qwerties." The process involved:
- Preprocessing the data
- Designing the neural network architecture with PyTorch
- Training the model
- Evaluating its performance
- Visualizing the results using various performance metrics

This project helped me understand the basics of single-output classification and how to tune models for better accuracy.

## 01_Multioutput_Qwerties

This notebook introduced me to multi-output classification for "Qwerties." The steps included:
- Generating and preprocessing the necessary data
- Designing and training a robust ANN model using PyTorch
- Evaluating and visualizing the model's performance

This project deepened my understanding of advanced classification techniques and how to interpret model results in a multi-output context.

## 02_Multioutput_Flowers

Building on the Qwerties project, this notebook focused on multi-output classification tasks for different species of flowers. The process involved:
- Importing and processing the dataset
- Creating a more complex ANN capable of handling multiple outputs
- Training the model
- Analyzing and visualizing the modelâ€™s predictions

This project allowed me to grasp the intricacies of multi-label classification and how to effectively handle such datasets.
